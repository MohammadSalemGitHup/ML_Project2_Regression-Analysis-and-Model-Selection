# ML_Project2_Regression-Analysis-and-Model-Selection

The objective of this project is to build a series of regression models using a dataset, evaluate and
compare their performance, and apply various techniques to improve model accuracy and prevent
overfitting.
The focus will be on both linear and nonlinear regression models. also i use
feature selection methods and regularization techniques, followed by hyperparameter tuning, to
select the optimal model
